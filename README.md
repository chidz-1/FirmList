# Firm List

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

## My TODOs

Please run a global search on the term "TODO" to see my inline coding todos. In regards to the design spec, i ran out of time to complete the "expertise & reputation" & "client satisfaction" filters but given more time i'd be more than capable of getting that over the line - the component structure and redux store is in a state for that to simply be tagged on. Furthermore i would have used a shared component for this task as there is reusability according to the design :p Happy elaborate in person.

Below are the available scripts to run the project.
